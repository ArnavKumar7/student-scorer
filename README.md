# About

The student scorer web app is basically going to be used for maintaining all the scores of students in college and as well as in school at a single place. It can be used by teachers also as an admin who can add score for students. Students can maintain an account of their own profile too where they add their certificates and report cards all in a single place. It basically is going to be one-place storage system for all the student related activities.
The whole frontend and backend of the application has to be all built from RemixJS.

Hint: Google remix full stack application. In short, have a separate routing structure in the folder for backend APIs and a db folder to write the database queries to fetch the data from the SQLite Database.

# Checkpoints

1. Creating a Cloudflare D1 binding SQLite database for the student scoring system with all the database structure, for eg., a user table, score table, etc. with appropriate primary, foreign keys attributes added for easy querying.

2. Create an API in a separate folder structure of the app for generating HTTP requests.

3. Create separate authentication for student and admin with separate roles.

4. Have an UI+functionality to add data for each student in the database on the admin side.

5. Create an UI+functionality on the student side to view all their marks. (plus point if you add visualisation)
